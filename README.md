# Structure

The moon has three parts to it: a core, a mantle, and a crust. It’s important to know what the moon is made up of to understand the features.

The core of the moon is smaller than that of the cores of other terrestrial bodies. It’s believed to be solid and iron-rich, and is around 149 mi/240 km in radius. It’s surrounded by a liquid iron shell that is around 56 mi/90 km thick. A layer that is partially molten surrounds the iron core and is around 93 mi/150 km thick.

The moon’s mantle is from the top of the layer that is partially molten to the bottom of the crust of the moon. It’s made up of mostly minerals such as olivine and pyroxene, and they are made up of magnesium, iron, silicon, and oxygen atoms.

The crust is around 43 mi/70 km thick on the near-side of the moon’s hemisphere and 93 mi/150 km thick on the far-side. The crust consists of oxygen, silicon, magnesium, iron, calcium, and aluminum, with other amounts of titanium, thorium, potassium, and hydrogen.

At one time in the moon’s history it had active volcanoes but they haven’t erupted in millions of years and are all dormant.

There is only a minor atmosphere on the moon, and it is so sparse that it can’t slow down or stop any of the meteoroids, asteroids, or comets that strike the surface. For this reason, the moon’s surface has an incredible number of craters. The Tycho Crater is over 52 mi/85 km wide.

These impacts have continued over billions of years and have ground up the surface of the moon into pieces that are as large as boulders to fine powder. Almost the entire surface of the moon is covered in a charcoal-gray powdery dust and rocks that are called the “lunar regolith.” Beneath the fractured bedrock area is a region called the “megaregolith.”

The dusty powder that is on the moon was thought to be similar to the dust on Earth. However, when the astronauts spent time on moon’s surface they discovered that they had cuts and slits in their spacesuits.

They couldn’t explain them until scientists looked at the moon dust under a microscope and discovered that they looked like sharp pieces of miniature glass.

Without the benefit of erosion and wind like we have on Earth, the tiny particles of dust had sharp edges and it was the dust that was collecting on the spacesuits that was causing the slices as they moved in them.
The surface of the moon has lighter areas that are called the highlands. It also has darker features that are referred to as “maria,” which is Latin for seas.

These are impact basins that were lava filled around 4.2-1.2 billion years ago. Both the dark and light areas are made up of different compositions and show how the moon’s early crust might have risen and crystallized from the magma ocean.

The craters may be billions of years old and scientists study them to get an idea of the history of impacts that the moon experienced. This history can tell them a lot about impacts from other bodies in the inner solar system.

The surface of the moon also has some of the equipment that the astronauts left, including an American flag, a camera, and medallions to honor the U.S. and Soviet astronauts that were lost in the quest to explore space.

Gravity on the moon is one-sixth of that on Earth and if you ever watched the videos of the astronauts on the moon you would see them bouncing across the surface.
